BattleHack2014

Hackathon vision was for an app that matched local donations with their local charities via google maps. 
We prototyped a location-based webapp giving donor users the ability to drop location pins for their curb-side donations, allowing other good samaritans to see if there are donations they can pick up along the way to their local charities.
We used local open data about Boston charities to populate our map.
Unfortunately we did not finish the routing algorithm component during the one night hackathon.

January 2016: Running out of private repos, so I made this public since our dev credentials are invalid now: our heroku free account where this is hosted is invalid now and mongohq no longer runs anymore. - Wilson
